			<h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
			<p>The Grand Canyon  is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado
				River in the state of Arizona in the United States. It is contained
				within and managed by Grand Canyon National Park, the Hualapai Tribal Nation,
				the Havasupai Tribe and the Navajo Nation. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent
				of preservation of the Grand Canyon area, and visited it on numerous occasions
				to hunt and enjoy the scenery.
				The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and
				attains a depth of over a mile (6,000 feet or 1,800 meters)</p>
			<h2>The Rocky Mountains</h2>
			<p>The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range
			in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 3,000 miles
			(4,830 km) from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada,
			to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American
			Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the
			Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie farther to the west.</p>
