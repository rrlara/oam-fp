## Building

Font Library is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you're just updating tags in `families.json`, you don't need to build the site locally. But you can if you prefer to see your changes before you submit a pull request.

To build it locally, you will need to:

* [Install Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll)
* Install Bundler: `bundle install`

To build the site:

`rake serve`

or

`bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`

To test the site run:

`rake test`
